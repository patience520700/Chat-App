            Efua (28, Ghanaian Mathematician(not you Efua)) never believed long-distance could work until she matched with Kwame (32, Ivorian architect) on L💞venett. "The language exchange feature helped us bridge French and English," she laughs. Their first voice message lasted 3 hours. After months of daily chats, Kwame surprised her by arriving in Accra with a handmade necklace. They're now planning a December wedding in Abidjan. "Lovenett didn't just connect hearts—it built our bilingual future," Efua says.</p>
